# PyQtRibbon
#### By RoadrunnerWMC
VERY EARLY UNFINISHED VERSION

A Python module for creating ribbon UIs with PyQt5. Quite underpowered at the moment.


## Installation Instructions
- Navigate to your Python installation
- Click on "Lib", then "site-packages"
- Make a new folder called "PyQtRibbon"
- Paste all these files in there
- Restart Python, if you have it running already
- Test that it is installed properly by opening a Python shell and typing
`
from PyQtRibbon.Ribbon import QRibbon
`
- If nothing happens, everything's fine. If you see  
`
Traceback (most recent call last):  
  File "<pyshell#0>", line 1, in <module>  
    from PyQtRibbon.Ribbon import QRibbon  
ImportError: No module named 'PyQtRibbon'  
`
  or another error, then you messed up somehow.
